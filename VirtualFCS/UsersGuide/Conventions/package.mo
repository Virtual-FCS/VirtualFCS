Additional headings in the html documentation should start with \"h4\".</p><p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">In the Modelica package the following conventions are used:</p><ol style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><li>Class and instance names are written in upper and lower case letters, e.g., \"ElectricCurrent\". An underscore is only used at the end of a name to characterize a lower or upper index, e.g., \"pin_a\".</li><li><b>Class names</b>&nbsp;start always with an upper case letter.</li><li><b>Instance names</b>, i.e., names of component instances and of variables (with the exception of constants), start usually with a lower case letter with only a few exceptions if this is common sense (such as \"T\" for a temperature variable).</li><li><b>Constant names</b>, i.e., names of variables declared with the \"constant\" prefix, follow the usual naming conventions (= upper and lower case letters) and start usually with an upper case letter, e.g. UniformGravity, SteadyState.</li><li>The two connectors of a domain that have identical declarations and different icons are usually distinguished by \"_a\", \"_b\" or \"_p\", \"_n\", e.g., Flange_a/Flange_b, HeatPort_a, HeatPort_b.</li><li>The&nbsp;<b>instance name</b>&nbsp;of a component is always displayed in its icon (= text string \"%name\") in&nbsp;<b>blue color</b>. A connector class has the instance name definition in the diagram layer and not in the icon layer.&nbsp;<b>Parameter</b>&nbsp;values, e.g., resistance, mass, gear ratio, are displayed in the icon in&nbsp;<b>black color</b>in a smaller font size as the instance name.</li><li>A main package has usually the following subpackages:<ul><li><b>UsersGuide</b>&nbsp;containing an overall description of the library and how to use it.</li><li><b>Examples</b>&nbsp;containing models demonstrating the usage of the library.</li><li><b>Interfaces</b>&nbsp;containing connectors and partial models.</li><li><b>Types</b>&nbsp;containing type, enumeration and choice definitions.</li></ul></li></ol></body></html>"));
